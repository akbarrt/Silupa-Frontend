## Silupa Harvest & Distribution Dashboard

An interactive React dashboard for managing agricultural harvests, stock inventory, storage capacity, and distribution flows. The app is built with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives, and Recharts.

It provides an opinionated UI shell (sidebar + top bar) with pages for:

- **Dashboard** – High‑level KPIs (total harvest, available stock, distributed stock), harvest trends, storage capacity, and recent activity.
- **Inventory** – Table of harvest lots and storage information, with an **Add Harvest** modal for capturing new entries.
- **Distribution** – Timeline view of dispatches and deliveries.
- **Reports** – Charts and tables for analysing harvest and distribution over time.
- **Settings** – Placeholder for application preferences.
- **About / How It Works** – Static informational pages describing the solution.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build tool:** Vite
- **Routing:** `react-router-dom`
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + custom design tokens in `tailwind.config.js`
- **UI primitives:** Radix UI (`@radix-ui/*`) with headless components wrapped in `src/components/ui/*`
- **Icons:** `lucide-react`
- **Charts:** `recharts`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- `npm` (bundled with Node) or another package manager

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd silupa
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be generated by Vite in the default `dist` folder.

## Project Structure

Key folders and files:

- `index.html` – Vite entry HTML file.
- `src/index.tsx` – React entry point that mounts the app.
- `src/App.tsx` – Top‑level router and layout wrapper (`AppShell`).
- `src/components/` – Reusable UI and layout components.
	- `AppShell.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `TopBar.tsx`, `MobileNav.tsx` – Global layout & navigation.
	- `dashboard/*` – KPI cards, charts, and recent activity widgets.
	- `inventory/*` – Inventory table and add‑harvest modal.
	- `distribution/*` – Distribution timeline.
	- `ui/*` – Button, card, dialog, input, select, toast, etc. (Radix‑based primitives).
- `src/pages/` – Route components for Dashboard, Inventory, Distribution, Reports, Settings, About, How It Works.
- `tailwind.config.js` & `tailwind.css` – Tailwind configuration and base styles.
- `vite.config.ts` – Vite configuration.

---

## Development Notes

- Routing is configured in `src/App.tsx` using `react-router-dom` with an `AppShell` layout route.
- UI elements in `src/components/ui` wrap Radix primitives; prefer using these instead of raw Radix components to keep styling consistent.
- Charts are implemented with `recharts` and are primarily present in dashboard and reports components.

---

## Customization

- **Branding & colors:** Update Tailwind theme tokens in `tailwind.config.js` and any global styles in `src/index.css` / `tailwind.css`.
- **Navigation items:** Edit the sidebar/top bar configuration in `AppShell` / navigation components.
- **Data integration:** Replace mocked/static data in dashboard, inventory, distribution, and reports components with real API calls or state management according to your backend.
