# 🌾 Silupa Harvest & Distribution Dashboard

**SiLupa (Sistem Lumbung Panen)** is a web-based application designed to digitize and streamline the management of agricultural harvest storage, inventory, distribution, and reporting.

The system aims to improve transparency, efficiency, and data accuracy in post-harvest management by providing a modern, scalable, and user-friendly digital platform.

---

## 🌟 Overview

Agricultural harvest management often relies on manual records, which can lead to data inconsistency, inefficiency, and lack of transparency.  
SiLupa addresses this problem by offering a centralized digital dashboard that enables stakeholders to monitor harvest stock, storage capacity, and distribution activities in real time.

This repository currently contains the **frontend application**, built with modern web technologies and designed to be easily integrated with a backend API.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

-  **Dashboard Overview**  
  Real-time summary of harvest stock, storage availability, and distribution status.

-  **Harvest Inventory Management**  
  Record, update, and monitor harvest data in a structured format.

-  **Distribution Tracking**  
  Track outgoing harvest distribution and maintain clear records.

-  **Reports & Analytics**  
  Visualize harvest trends and generate data-driven insights.

-  **System Settings**  
  Configuration and preferences for system usage (planned).

-  **Responsive Interface**  
  Optimized for desktop and tablet usage.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals
- Improve transparency in harvest storage and distribution
- Reduce manual data recording and errors
- Provide a digital foundation for agricultural inventory systems
- Build a scalable platform for future backend integration

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.
- Node.js 18+ recommended
- `npm` or `yarn` package manager

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd silupa
npm install
```

### Run the development server

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

---

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be generated by Vite in the default `dist` folder.

## Project Structure

Key folders and files:

- `index.html` – Vite entry HTML file.
- `src/index.tsx` – React entry point that mounts the app.
- `src/App.tsx` – Top‑level router and layout wrapper (`AppShell`).
- `src/components/` – Reusable UI and layout components.
	- `AppShell.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `TopBar.tsx`, `MobileNav.tsx` – Global layout & navigation.
	- `dashboard/*` – KPI cards, charts, and recent activity widgets.
	- `inventory/*` – Inventory table and add‑harvest modal.
	- `distribution/*` – Distribution timeline.
	- `ui/*` – Button, card, dialog, input, select, toast, etc. (Radix‑based primitives).
- `src/pages/` – Route components for Dashboard, Inventory, Distribution, Reports, Settings, About, How It Works.
- `tailwind.config.js` & `tailwind.css` – Tailwind configuration and base styles.
- `vite.config.ts` – Vite configuration.

---

## Development Notes

- Routing is configured in `src/App.tsx` using `react-router-dom` with an `AppShell` layout route.
- UI elements in `src/components/ui` wrap Radix primitives; prefer using these instead of raw Radix components to keep styling consistent.
- Charts are implemented with `recharts` and are primarily present in dashboard and reports components.

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control (Planned)
 
- User authentication using JWT

- Role-based access control:
  - Admin
  - Farmer
  - Storage Manager
- Secure API communication
- Input validation and access guards

---

## 🧩 Application Architecture

SiLupa is designed as a frontend-first application that communicates with backend services through REST APIs.

### Key architectural principles:

- Separation of concerns between UI and data logic
- Scalable component-based structure
- API-ready integration without major refactoring
- Clean and maintainable codebase
